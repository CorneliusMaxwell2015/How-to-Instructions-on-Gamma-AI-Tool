I can help you with that Git command!

`git fetch` retrieves updates from your remote repository (like GitHub) without merging them into your local branches. This is useful for:

- Checking for new commits on remote branches
- Staying updated without automatically merging changes
- Reviewing what others have pushed before integrating

**To run this in VS Code's integrated terminal:**

1. Press `Ctrl + `` (backtick) to open the integrated terminal
2. Type `git fetch` and press Enter

**Common variations:**

- `git fetch origin` - Fetch from the default remote
- `git fetch origin main` - Fetch a specific branch
- `git fetch --all` - Fetch from all configured remotes

After fetching, you can review changes with `git diff` or merge them with `git merge` or `git pull` (which combines fetch + merge).
